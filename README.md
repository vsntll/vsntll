### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Avie Vasantlal and as of 2024, I am a 2nd year Computer Engineering Student at Penn State.
I have a background of C++, Python and Java which I plan to display here on my Github going into the future.
I have a larger understanding of Electrical Engineering and may commit some Arduino code and such going into the future.
