### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Avie Vasantlal and as of May 2025, I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering Major with Computer Science Minor attending Penn State.
I have a background of C++, C, Python and Java which I plan to display here on my Github going into the future.
I have a larger understanding of Electrical Engineering and may commit some Arduino code and such going into the future alongside some Machine Learning projects I am working on.


I am currently experienced in C, Java, C++, Jupyter Notebook, Javascript and Python.
