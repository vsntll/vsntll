### Hi there 👋
My name is Avie Vasantlal and as of September 2025, I am a 4th year Computer Engineering Major with Computer Science Minor attending Penn State.
I have a background of C++, C, Python and Java which I plan to display here on my Github going into the future. I'm also actively learning React + Vite, Svelte, Typescript, Javascript & Go.
I have a larger understanding of Electrical Engineering and may commit some Arduino code and such going into the future alongside some Machine Learning projects I am working on.


I am currently experienced in C, Embedded C, C++, Python, Go, C, Rust and Java
